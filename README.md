# What is this?

This is the officially supported boilerplate for creating websites using [muffin][1]. Although we encourage you to build on top of this, you're free to completely change the structure of this. Muffin won't give a fuck.

## Get started

If you just want to create new project using muffin, please take a look at the [documentation][2].

## Contribute

But if you want to help us with the development of this thing, clone the repo...

```shell
git clone git://github.com/leo/generator-muffin.git
cd generator-muffin
```

... install all other dependencies ...

```shell
npm install gulp yo -g
npm install
```

... and link the generator to global scope

```shell
npm link
```

Now you're able to try it out by running:

```shell
yo muffin
```
