# What is this?

This is the officially supported boilerplate for creating websites using [muffin][1]. Although we encourage you to build on top of this, you're free to completely change the structure of this. Muffin won't give a fuck.

## Get started

If you just want to create new project using muffin, please take a look at the [documentation][2].

## Contribute

### Change sample data

To export the data from your MongoDB, use this command:

```bash
mongoexport --db <db_name> --collection <collection_name> --out output.json --jsonArray --pretty
```
