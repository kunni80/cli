# What is this?

This is the officially supported boilerplate for creating websites using [muffin][1]. Although we encourage you to build on top of this, you're free to completely change the structure of this. Muffin won't give a fuck.

## Get started

If you just want to create new project using this, firstly make sure to install muffin's command line interface:

```shell
npm install muffin-cli -g
```

And then create a new project

```shell
muffin new sample
```

## Contribute

But if you want to help us with the development of this thing, clone the repo...

```shell
git clone git://github.com/leo/baking-pan.git
cd baking-pan
```

... and install all dependencies:

```shell
npm install gulp -g && npm install
```
